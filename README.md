==============

This code was used and developed through Udacity's Machine Learning Course. The final project, found in final_project/poi_id.py, was developed to identify Person's of Interest using the publicly available Enron Dataset. The code was inspired by concepts presented throughout the course. This course was incredibly useful in learning about supervised and unsupervised classification algorithms, Pandas (especially in the final project), sklearn, kernel development, etc.
